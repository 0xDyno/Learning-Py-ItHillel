                }
            ]

The final structure:
    > Harry Potter
    -> Movie title 1 (derictory)
    --> A (dedirectory)
    ----> A award (file)
    ----> A2 award (file)
    
    .....
    --> Z (dedirectory)
    ----> Z award (file)
    ----> Z2 award (file)
    -> Name of the movie 2 (derictory)
    --> A (dedirectory)
    ----> A award (file)
    ----> A2 award (file)
    
    .....
    --> Z (dedirectory)
    ----> Z award (file)
    ----> Z2 award (file)
